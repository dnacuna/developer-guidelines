# Introduction

NUBOMEDIA is an open source cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) which makes
possible to integrate Real Time Communications (RTC) and multimedia through
advanced media processing capabilities. The aim of NUBOMEDIA is to democratize
multimedia technologies helping all developers to include advanced multimedia
capabilities into their Web and smartphone applications in a simple, direct and
fast manner. To accomplish that objective, NUBOMEDIA provides a set of APIs
that try to abstract all the low level details of service deployment,
management, and exploitation allowing applications to transparently scale and
adapt to the required load while preserving QoS guarantees.

The capabilities provided by NUBOMEDIA are going to be shown by a set of
application called demonstrators, which are going to be built using the first
official release of the NUBOMEDIA APIs.
